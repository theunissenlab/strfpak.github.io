<h1>What are STRFs?</h1>

There is increasing evidence that sensory systems have evolved to optimally
process behaviorally relevant natural stimuli. The spatiotemporal receptive
field (STRF) describes the linear
transformation between a time varying spatial stimulus and the neural
response.<p>
 
STRFs were first used to describe the properties of neurons in the auditory
system but are now commonly used in other sensory modalities
(Theunissen et al, 2001).<p>

<h1>What Do We Do?</h1>

The goal of the project is to develop a general methodology to estimate
the stimulus response transfer function of sensory neurons. The estimation
techniques are based on the well-known reverse correlation methods but
with two significant extensions. First we are developing methods that can
be used for any complex stimuli including natural stimuli. Second, we are
developing a variety of complementary non-linear estimation techniques.
These data analysis tools will be implemented in a user-friendly software
package with extensive help and examples.
