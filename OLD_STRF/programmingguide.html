<h2> <a name="program_guide"><b>Programming Guide</a></b></h2>
<p><b>Purpose:</b><p>
Your code should be easy to read and interpret.
This is especially important at
a later time if you or someone else updates your code. The following guides will 
help you develop a programming style that will enhance the readability of your
code: <br>
<p><b>Comment:</b><p>
It is considered good programming practice to include
comment lines. Comment lines, indicated by a % in Matlab or /* xxx */ in C, add
information, such as the purpose of the program, definition of variables, and
the purpose of statements within the program. A comment indicating the units of
measure that correspond to numeric values will also help in the interpretation
of results. Comments are printed in the listing of a program, but are otherwise
ignored; they do not affect program execution.

It is recommended that each code be commented at the beginning to tell
<ul>
 <li>What it does; </li>
 <li>How it is being done;</li>
 <li>What the parameters mean;</li>
 <li>Who wrote the code and when;</li>
 <li>Revision History;</li>
</ul>


&nbsp;<p><b>Blank lines:</b><p>
Within the code, use blank lines to separate the different steps of the
algorithm.

<p><b>Modularization:</b>

<p>A fundamental approach to solving large, complex
problems is to break the problem down into smaller problems. Then, solutions can 
be found for these smaller problems and organized in such a manner as to address 
the original problem. In a similar way, problems that require long, complex
Matlab code can be broken down into function units. In addition to the main
program unit, Matlab or C programs can call Matlab function or subprogram
written in other languages. Modularization allow the programmer to organize
programs in a logical, hierarchical fashion. There are several advantages to
modularize your program:
<ul>
  <li>they help keep the code simple, and, thus, more readable;
  </li>
  <li>they allow the programmer to use the same code as many times as needed
  throughout the program;
  </li>
  <li>they allow the programmer to define needed functions; and,
  </li>
  <li>they can be used in other programs.
  </li>
  </ul>

<p><br>
Example <br>
Assume that this is the pseudo-code for a desired sequence of operations: <br>
<br>
read the data from a file; <br>
perform calculations based on the data read; <br>
post-process the data; and, <br>
save the data in a new file. <br>
<br>
<br>
The program could be written with five program units: a main program and four
subprograms: GETFILE, CALCULATION, PPROCESS and NEWFILE. This will help to add
or modify some modules later and improve the code's maintainability.<br>
&nbsp;

<br>
<p><b>Documentation:</b><p>

It is strongly recommended that every application or run procedure have a
README file which documents the following things:

<ul>
  <li>General description of the application.</li>
  <li>Description of what the code does</li>
  <li>Who wrote the code and when.</li>
  <li>Algorithms used.</li>
  <li>Library and program dependencies.</li>
  <li>Design restriction.</li>
  <li>Inputs.</li>
  <li>Output.</li>
  <li>Known bugs.</li>
  <li>Revision History.</li>
 </ul>
