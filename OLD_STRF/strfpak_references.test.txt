1. STRF calculation
1. DeBoer, E. & Kuyper, P. (1968), "Triggered Correlation," IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 15, 159-179.
This is the first reverse correlation method paper (rev-cor).  DeBoer showed that the spike-triggered average is an estimator of the cross-correlation between the stimulus and the response.  For white-noise a scaled version of the spike-triggered average is the linear filter between the stimulus and the response.  At this point there is no spatial dimension. 
2. Aertsen, A. M. & Johannesma, P. I. (1981), "The spectro-temporal receptive field. A functional characteristic of auditory neurons," Biol Cybern 42, 133-43.
The first paper describing the STRF for auditory neurons.  Aertsen, Eggermont and Young all used the STRF in the auditory periphery in the 1980’s.  They concluded that it was not a particularly useful technique because neurons responded poorly to white-noise or because the STRF estimated from responses to white-noise gave poor predictions for responses to natural or complex stimuli.  This was before dynamic ripples and our techniques.

 Graduate level textbook on estimation techniques for time series.  An excellent book for background material for students involved in development of STRF estimation techniques.
4. Ringach, D. L., Sapiro, G. & Shapley, R. (1997), "A subspace reverse-correlation technique for the study of visual neurons," Vision Res 37, 2455-64.
A visual STRF paper that shows that STRFs can be estimated with a restricted set of stimuli but that this imposes some restrictions on the STRF that one can obtain.

The STRF calculation using dynamic ripples. This paper also has a very good description of time-frequency tradeoffs for STRFs.

Ben is a post-doc in Jack’s lab. This paper is now in press. You can get a pdf by asking Ben. 
8.  Maneesh Sahani and Jennifer Linden (NIPS 2002): Evidence optimization techniques for estimating stimulus-response functions.  
This is a NIPS proceeding paper that explains the use of Bayesian Techniques for auditory STRF estimation.  Maneesh and Jen are post-docs at UCSF.  The paper is available on line but you have to download the entire NIPS text for 2002. It would be easier to contact Maneesh to get a copy.

2. STRF validation.
There is very little published on this topic.
Here are two papers in pre-print format:
1. Maneesh Sahani and Jennifer Linden: How linear are auditory cortical responses? (NIPS  2002)
This is a NIPS proceeding paper that describes how one can use a signal to noise power estimation to validate STRF responses.  The paper is available on line but you have to download the entire NIPS text for 2002. It would be easier to contact Maneesh to get a copy.

2. Hsu Anne et al. (To be submitted) Quantifying variability in neural responses and its application for the validation of model predictions
This paper will be submitted to Network soon.  It describes a method that we use to validate the STRFs.  It is similar mathematically to the method of Maneesh.  We both developed similar ideas around the same time but using a different parameter: we use coherence and correlation coefficient and Maneesh uses signal to noise ratio.  The two are directly  related mathematically.
