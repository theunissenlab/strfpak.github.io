<h2><a name="whatisstrfpak">
Question 1.1.  What is STRFPAK?
</a></h2>

STRFPAK is a matlab toolbox for estimating the spatio-temporal receptive fields
(STRFs) of sensory neurons from their responses to arbitrary stimuli.
It includes two different measures to quantify the estimated STRF's goodness
of fit. For ease of use, STRFPAK is implemented as Matlab Graphic User 
Interface program.
<p>

<h2><a name="whereisstrfpak">
Question 1.2.  How do I obtain STRFPAK?
</a></h2>

STRFPAK can be downloaded at 
<a href="http://strfpak.berkeley.edu/download.html">
the STRFPAK download page</a>.
<p>
 
<h2><a name="isstrfpakfree">
Question 1.3.  Is STRFPAK free software?
</a></h2>

Right now, it is.
<p>

<h2><a name="system">
Question 1.4.  Which required systems does STRFPAK need?
</a></h2>

The current version STRFPAK is written in Matlab. It runs on
any operating systems which Matlab can run. But it also requires
Matlab with its Signal Processing Toolbox, Statistics Toolbox and
Optimization Toolbox.
<p>

<h2><a name="language">
Question 1.5. Which language is STRFPAK written in?</a></h2>

The version 0.1 of STRFPAK is written in Matlab. 
<p>

<h2><a name="vertcat">
Question 2.1. What need you do when you get 
"The expression on this line will generate an error when executed.  The error
will be: Error using ==> vertcat
All rows in the bracketed expression must have the same
number of columns." or "Index exceeds matrix dimensions" message?
</a></h2>

"Vercat" error message usually tells us something wrong with your input
   data selection. You may go back to the main window and click "Get
   Files" button. The rightmost list box in the "Get Input file" window
   shows your selection: the data set should include stimuli and response
   data in this exact order. First field is stimulus and the second field
   is neuron response data. If you reverse this order, you may get this
   error.
<p>

<h2><a name="hanning">
Question 2.2.
Why do you get the error message "Undefined function or variable: hanning"?
</a></h2>

"Undefined function or variable: hanning " means your matlab does not
   include hanning.m function. "hanning" function belongs to Matlab
   signal processing toolbox. If your matlab does not have this toolbox,
   you will get this error.
