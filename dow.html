<h3>STRFPAK code:</h3>







<br>

<h3>STRFPAK 5.3 is now available</h3>


<a href="OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK_5.3.zip">Version 5.3</a> has a new
checksum feature which uses the built-in md5 function of your Mac or
Linux box (as long as ssl can be found in /usr/bin/openssl). &nbsp;This
new checksum is faster, less memory-intensive and less likely to
generate hash collisions.<br>

<br>

The documentation has also been cleaned up slightly.
<h3>STRFPAK 5.2 has arrived</h3>


<a href="OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK_5.2.zip">Version 5.2</a> has all the new features of version 5.2 beta 2 (see below), plus the following numerical enhancements:<br>


<ul>


  <li>Two improvements have been made in how the autocorrelation
is calculated. &nbsp;
    
    
    <ol>


      <li>STRFPAK now automatically decides if it is
faster to calculate the autocorrelation with a time-domain or a
Fourier-domain method. &nbsp;Fourier-domain methods are faster for
STRFs with a large number of latencies, while time-domain methods are
faster for STRFs with fewer latencies. &nbsp;STRFPAK thus far has
used only Fourier-domain stimulus autocorrelation, but time-domain
algorithms are faster when the number of latencies is less than the
logarithm of the number of time samples.
&nbsp;</li>


      <li>
If a Fourier-domain algorithm is faster, STRFPAK now calculates the
Fourier transform of each spatial stimulus band only once, then
computes the inverse FFT of the product of the pre-computed Fourier
transforms of the stimulus, reducing the total number of Fourier
transforms needed by a factor of 3. </li>


    
    
    </ol>



  </li>


  <li>STRFPAK now also uses a time-domain algorithm for
stimulus-response cross correlation where it is faster.</li>


</ul>



The new numerical methods help especially in the types of problems
often encountered with visual STRFs. &nbsp;For example, with a STRF with
1500 spatial dimensions, 8000 time samples and just one latency,
previous STRFPAK versions took nearly 9 hours; with the new numerics
the same STRF can be calculated in 7 minutes.<br>



<h3></h3>







<h3>STRFPAK 5.2 beta 2 is available for download</h3>









<a href="OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK_5.2_beta2.zip">STRFPAK 5.2 beta 2</a>
is now available. &nbsp;It now has batch mode support for saved
subspaces and negative firing rates. &nbsp;Numerical issues have been
fixed, and a few GUI improvements have been made over version 5.2 beta.<br>




<br>







<h4>Local Caches</h4>




One large improvement over previous versions is that version 5.2 beta 2
caches cell-specific files in a local directory instead of in the main
cache directory. &nbsp;If your performance is taking a hit because you
have thousands of cached files in a central directory, erase the
contents ofyour cache directory and try STRFPAK 5.2 beta 2. <br>







<h4>Saved subspaces</h4>





Message April 10 2007: the numerical flaw in the beta code has been fixed in version 5.2 beta 2.<br>






<br>







If
you have presented stimuli from two different classes (like natural
sounds and noise stimuli) and find you have different STRFs, you might
want to compare the STRFs to see what stimulus-dependent nonlinearities
are in the neuron's transfer function. &nbsp;Until now, you could not be
sure if differences in the STRF were due to real nonlinearities or to
the fact that stimuli with different statistics cause STRFs to be
projected into different subspaces when tolerance values are applied.
&nbsp;Now, every time STRFPAK is run,&nbsp;pointers to the cached subspace are
saved. &nbsp;Future STRFPAK sessions can choose to project STRFs into the
saved subspaces (if desired) so as to apply exactly the same bias to
STRFs as in the original run. &nbsp;Select a saved subspace from the
"Special options" panel, new to STRFPAK 5.2.<br>







<h4>Negative firing rates</h4>







Until
version 5.2, STRFPAK has assumed that firing rates always have to be
positive. &nbsp;This restriction is appropriate for typical STRFPAK runs,
but if users choose to use STRFPAK for other purposes, the
positive-rate requirement can be disabled in the "Special options"
panel, new to STRFPAK 5.2.<br>







<h4>Beta testing</h4>







Please keep me informed as to whether version 5.2 beta 2 works as advertised. &nbsp;<br>







<br>







<h3> STRFPAK 5.1.1 here </h3>













Download the latest stable version of <a href="OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK_5.1.1.zip">STRFPAK: 5.1.1</a>.
&nbsp;5.1.1 contains two bug fixes over 5.1.0: it fixes a bug with
calculating separable receptive fields, and it is less sensitive to the
format of input spike time .dat and .txt files.<br>








<a href="OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK_5.1.0.zip">STRFPAK 5.1.0</a> is more flexible and stable than previous versions. &nbsp;In
particular, it now handles auditory data with unusual sampling
frequencies (like those needed for bat audition, or the 24 414 Hz
sampling frequency imposed by some stimulus-presenting rigs) in a
better way. &nbsp;Stimuli are now upsampled to the nearest
multiple of the PSTH sampling rate to avoid any possible beat effects
between these two sampling frequencies. &nbsp;<br>










<br>










Here is a point-form list of all the improvements version 5.1.0 has
over version 5.0.5:<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>










</span>
<ul>









  <li>Better handling of diverse sound sampling rates</li>









  <li>Preprocessed auditory data now simply in .mat files
(download the sample preprocessed files for examples)</li>









  <li>For Windows machines, now STRFPAK is less picky about the
directory-separating character (it can be "/" or "\", but "\" is still
recommended for maximum backwards compatibility)</li>









  <li>Thanks to Yale, Noopur, Channing, Angela, and Johanna for
your feedback, suggestions, and contributed code. &nbsp;</li>









</ul>









<h3>Older Versions of STRFPAK:</h3>






















<p>Download <a href="OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK_4.4.1.zip">STRFPAK 4.4.1</a>
, containing a bug fix for version 4.4, which was incompatible with
some older MATLAB versions, and has&nbsp;the following improvements
over version <a href="OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK_4.3.zip">4.3</a>:</p>















<ul>















  <li>Various speed and reliability improvements.</li>















  <li>If you validate, the best STRF is now saved in a file called "best_strf.mat".</li>















  <li>Fixed a bug with "Display StimStat" when using a
cache.&nbsp; Now
StimStat works properly always.</li>















  <li>Added&nbsp;user-defined function support for 1-D
(auditory) stims. &nbsp;Now, you can use your favourite home-grown
function (spectrograms, pitch detectors, etc.) natively with STRFPAK.
&nbsp;Just make sure</li>















  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>















    <li>Your function is in the
your path and that it takes just the stimulus as an input (i.e.
hard-code all the parameter values you want). </li>















    <li> Your function returns the
transformation you want as the first output argument.
    </li>















  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>















 Then
select the "User's Own Formula" in the STRFPAK Preprocessing
Menu. &nbsp;User-defined functions are supported automatically by
both the cache and the STRFPAK_script (batch mode) protocol.
  <li>Loading data is faster thanks to:
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>















      <li>Automatic recognition of .wav files and matching spike
files in the current directory.</li>















      <li>New hashing protocol makes hashing the transformed
stimuli unnecessary.</li>















    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>
















  </li>















  <li>If the automatic recognition of .wav files works with your file
names, running a cell in batch mode can now be as easy as typing "cd
&lt;data directory&gt; ; STRFPAK_script;".</li>















  <li>Made STRFPAK more resilient to unequal numbers of trials
for different stimuli.</li>















</ul>
















<h3>New since version 4.0.2</h3>















<p>It's much faster:<br>





















</p>





















<ul>





















  <li>It allows you to cache results so that you only need to calculate
stimulus autocorrelations once, EVER, per stimulus.&nbsp; STRFs for new
neurons but familiar stimuli can take about a minute to calculate.</li>





















  <li>New numerical algorithms speed up validation by about a factor of
10 and goodness of fit estimation by a factor of 2.&nbsp; When you add
a tolerance value, now you don't have to repeat any calculation you
have done.</li>




















  <li>It can now remember the parameters you specify, so you do not have to select the same options repeatedly.</li>





















</ul>





















<p>It's more stable:<br>





















</p>





















<ul>





















  <li>We've fixed a difficulty where some versions of Matlab cannot open the preprocessing window.</li>




















  <li>Support for user-processed stimuli is improved.</li>





















</ul>





















<p>The STRFPAK_script file works and is easier to use than ever:<br>





















</p>





















<ul>





















  <li>We have a new system which allows anyone familiar with Matlab to
analyze many neurons in batch mode once they have run through the GUI
version of STRFPAK for a typical neuron.&nbsp; Now, no changes to the
STRFPAK_script.m file are needed - just save the locations of the data
files to a .mat file in a specified format and STRFPAK_script will work
with the new neural data.&nbsp; See the automatically-generated
STRFPAK_script.m file after a STRFPAK run for more details.</li>





















</ul>





















<p>Download <a href="./OLD_STRF/staffonly/STRFPAK-4.0.2.zip">STRFPAK-4.0.2.zip (0.5 MB)<br>





















</a></p>





















<p>To run this software start MATLAB, add the STRFPAK directory to your path, move to the data directory and at the prompt type:</p>
